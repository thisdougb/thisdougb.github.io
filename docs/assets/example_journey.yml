  # this is a future journey to add a feature
  # hardly any detail, more of a placeholder
  - destination: Be able to take subscriber payments

      - name: Implement payment service
      - name: Decide on a payment gateway
      - name: Investigate legal and terms

  # this is the current journey, because it has no 'done' key
  - destination: app refactored with CSP
    purpose: | 
      This is the time to make the code stable. 
      Refactor without adding new features. 
      CSP gives real-time event processing, and removes polling routines.

    waypoints:
      # some future waypoints as placeholders
      - name: Complete webui refactor
      - name: Complete mapboxint refactor

      - name: Complete stravaint refactor
        note: |
          Refactor the cleanest component first, to focus on CSP implementation.

        # a waypoint that contains waypoints is like a detour to do tasks on a component
        waypoints:
          - name: Simplify rate-limiting implementation
            component: stravaint
            note: |
              Remove rate-limiting dependency on Redis reads/writes.

          # this waypoint is the current one, because it has no 'done' key and
          # is the furthest from the journey destination. waypoints are in 
          # reverse order.
          - name: Simplest way to store Strava data on filesystem
            component: stravaint
            note: |
              Store activity summary and streams on filesystem.
              Makes troubleshooting simpler.

          - name: Defined CSP style guide
            done: Oct 23
            component: stravaint
            note: |
              Define pattern for objects to be passed as messages.

      - name: GR367 hiked, 260 km, 9000 m ascent, 10 days
        done: Oct 23
        note: |
          A hike to think about motivation, and getting this thing launched.

      - name: Figured out motivation, wrote about it
        done: Oct 23
        note: |
          On the GR367 hike, figured this out and wrote about it (We Were Promised Jetpacks).
          Feels good to understand the problem, with a way forward

      - name: Decided on CSP concurrent design pattern
        done: Sep 23
        note: |
          Decided to follow Go's natural CSP pattern for concurrency.
          More robust, event driven, and easier to test.
          Gets rid of awful polling routines.

      - name: Affric hiked, 190 km, found subscribers on GGW
        done: Aug 23
        note: |
          Trip to see AH, J, and B.
          Realised on the GGW the huge potential for walkers to be subscribers.
