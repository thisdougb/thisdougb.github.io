My goal is a profitable tech business where I am free to spend time travelling and doing creative stuff.

So I have begun a journey to build a super-efficient web business, with only one employee.
The rebellious nature of _one employee_ is motivating.

The app will help people create stories of their travels.

I have particular expertise is in scaling teams, processes and software.
Increasing productivity through automation and operational efficiency.
Doing more with less.

Preserving time and motivation are the chief challenges of launching and operating as a solo.
I have techniques up my sleeve to make computers do the hard work.
And am creating processes to help maintain motivation.

Building in public both helps me keep going, and will show how solo ventures are worthwhile journeys to take.
There are very few voices encouraging people to build tech as a solo.
We need to change that.

While travelling in France I wrote about motivation in [We Were Promised Jetpacks](/_posts/2023-11-02-we-were-promised-jetpacks.markdown).
It’s a good place on this journey to start.
At the beginning.

From there I created a framework, specifically for solos to sustain motivation and get things done.
I've called it the [Espresso Project Management Framework](/_posts/2023-11-03-espresso-project-management.markdown).

The journey continues…
