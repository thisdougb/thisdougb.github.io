_WHY_

A journey to build a scaled web app, run by one person.
The app will help people create stories of their travels.

The goal is a profitable tech business where I spend more time travelling and doing creative stuff.

_HOW_

My particular expertise is in scaling teams, processes and software.
Increasing productivity through automation and operational efficiency.

Preserving time and motivation are the chief challenges of launching and operating as a solo.
I have techniques up my sleeve to make computers do the hard work.
And am creating processes to stay motivated.

_By building in public_

Building in public both helps my own motivation, but will also show how solo ventures are worthwhile journeys to take.
There are very few voices encouraging people to build tech as a solo, we need to change that.

_WHAT_

While travelling in France I wrote about motivation in [We Were Promised Jetpacks](/_posts/2023-11-02-we-were-promised-jetpacks.markdown).
It’s a good place on this journey to start.
At the beginning.

From there I created a framework, specifically for solos to sustain motivation and get things done.
I call it the [Espresso Project Management Framework](/_posts/2023-11-03-espresso-project-management.markdown).

The journey continues…
