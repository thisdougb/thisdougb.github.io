Existing project management frameworks for software projects focus on fast delivery, rather than quality delivery.
The effect of this bias is compounded technical risk (euphimistically called technical debt), as a result of increasing entropy in the system.

A system (design, people, code, processes, etc) with growing entropy is increasingly difficult to work on.
Productivity and motivation both dwindle, and the software becomes clunky and temperamental to use.

Would you eat or work in a restaurant where the managers didn't believe in washing the dishes or clearing the tables?

For a solo creator, **time and motivation** are precious ingredients.
Without them, we falter.
Combined, they make us unstoppable.

An effective project management framework must preserve free-time by demanding high operational efficiency.
Therefore, automation is a required element in the design of processes and software components.

Motivation is trickier, we can only create conditions for it to flourish.
Prioritising feature quality over feature quantity.
Maintaining focus on what must be done now, rather than what may come later.

Finally, the framework must inherently reject entropy as an inevitability of building software.
As engineers, this is our rebellious action.

**A journey** is a simple, and ancient, mental abstraction of a large and complex project.
Being universally understood, there is no need for additional jargon or business-speak.

A journey (major piece of work) has a destination (outcome), reached via a series of waypoints (tasks).
It is flexible, and can cope with delays, detours, and alternate destinations.
Crucially, few real journeys seem to stall or be abandoned due to low motivation.

When the going gets tough, walking in the mountains, I take strength from looking backwards at progress made.
How we journey is inherently motivation boosting.

Having completed many long distance journeys, I feel solo tech ventures fit this abstraction perfectly.
So let's define a barely-there **espresso project mangagement framework**.

### Getting things done

My project management tool is a simple text file (in markdown format) as a journey log.
It started out in a bullet journal, to prevent over complication.

The active journey ``###`` and waypoints ``####`` are defined as headings.
Future journeys and waypoints are left as plain text.

Waypoints can be added to the current journey, if they are required to move us closer to journeys end.
This can happen if there are unforeseen challenges.

I try to be as ~~lazy~~ efficient as possible, so this file doubles as my company history.
On reaching a waypoint I record a little note for posterity and add the date.

Just like teams, solo's are much happier spending time productively.
Currently it's one espresso per waypoint reached, roughly half an hour of clock-time, to update the journey log.

### Example

This sample is taken from my current journey log.

```
## Journeys

Journey: Build community
Journey: Open app to paying subscribers
Journey: Add payment functionality

### Journey: App components refactored for stability

Time to make the code stable, as I move towards launch.

Waypoint: complete webui refactor
Waypoint: complete mapboxint refactor

#### Waypoint: Complete stravaint refactor

Refactor the cleanest component first, to focus on effective CSP implementation.

#### Waypoint [Oct 23]: GR367 hike, 260 km, 9000 m ascent, 10 days

Fantastic walk in the Pyrenees, met some good people. Feel motivated and ready to continue.

#### Waypoint [Oct 23]: Figured out motivation, wrote about it

Used GR367 hike to figure this out, wrote We Were Promised Jetpacks. Relief.

#### Waypoint [Oct 23]: Decided on CSP concurrent design pattern

Go's natural pattern for concurrency, brings easier testing and real-time processing.

#### Waypoint [Sep 23]: Affric hike, 190 km, found subscribers on GGW

Trip to see AH, J, and B. Realised the huge potential for one-trip subscription on trophy hikes.
```

It's really that simple.
By avoiding the performative elements commonly used in project management frameworks, what's required _is_ simple.

I've saved the niftiest thing till last.
Having a text file journey log meant I was able to automate a view of my journey as a wallpaper for my phone.

Every time I glance at my phone, the current waypoint to focus on is right there.
If I'm having a moment, then I can see solid progress is being made and take heart.
It's my handheld motivation booster.

And by moving non-essential app icons off the home screen, I must swipe past my project in order to waste time elsewhere.
A little nudge to spending time wisely.
I really wish I thought of this years ago.
