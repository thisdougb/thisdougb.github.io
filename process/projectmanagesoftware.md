_the challenge_

Existing project management frameworks for software projects focus on fast delivery, rather than quality delivery.
The effect of this bias is compounded technical risk (euphimistically called technical debt), as a result of increasing entropy in the system.

A system (design, people, code, processes, etc) with growing entropy is increasingly difficult to work on.
Productivity and motivation both dwindle, and the software becomes clunky and temperamental to use.

Would you eat or work in a restaurant where the managers didn't believe in washing the dishes or clearing the tables?

_WHY_

For a solo creator, time and motivation are precious ingredients.
In abstentia, we stop.
Combined, they make us unstoppable.

_HOW_

An effective project management framework must preserve free-time by demanding high operational efficiency.
Automation is a required element in the design of processes and software components.

Motivation is trickier, we can simply create the conditions to help it to flourish.
Prioritising feature quality over feature quantity.
Maintaining focus on what must be done now, rather than what may come later.
Building courage from achievements and progress made so far.

The framework must inherently reject entropy as an inevitability of building software.


_WHAT_

The _journey_ is a simple, and ancient, mental abstraction of a large and complex project.
It is universally understood, we've all been on a journey.

Having completed many long distance journeys, I feel this abstraction gives a solo tech project a greater chance of success.

A journey (major piece of work) has a destination (outcome), reached via a series of waypoints (tasks).
It is flexible, and can cope with delays, detours, and alternate destinations.
Crucially, few journeys seem to stall or be abandoned due to low motivation.

_motivation_

Motivation, the life force of a journey, is sustained by focusing only on the immediate waypoint.
A waypoint is an achievable task that comes with a boost on completion.

When the going gets tough, walking in the mountains, I take strength by looking backwards at progress made.
This framework emphasises what has been achieved, rather than dwell on what is yet to come.
It seeks to boost motivation, as a key ingredient of project success.

Naturally, therefore, no mental energy is spent on future waypoints.
This simply wastes time and can lead to loss of motivation.


If I can't absorb the operational cost of a feature, then its design is not good enough yet. Operational cost is a key factor in project descision making.



Now, a real journey example may help with understanding:

```
journeys end: refactored all components for robustness  
waypoint 6: refactor component B (design, code)
waypoint 5: refactor component A (design, code)
waypoint 4: master CSP in Go (learning)
waypoint 3: research concurrency patterns (learning)
waypoint 2: define operational requirements (design)
waypoint 1: define robustness plainly (design)
```

Note that the waypoints clearly lead to journeys end, but are not linear.

Waypoints 3 and 4 only became known once waypoint 2 was reached.
They were a little detour I needed to take, as a result of my operational requirements.
Flexibility in action.

Waypoints are tackled in series.
Multi-tasking is innefficient because no task gets full focus.

The final point is there is no further detail required.
I do not spend effort working out how long things will take.
As a motivated professional working for my own interests, what's the point in top-down time management?

In practical terms, here's how it works.

I go to my favourite cafe and order an espresso.
Then I follow these step to create a journey:

```
think on it, is this the right journey to take now?
set the journeys end
create the first waypoint
create any other assumed waypoints
``` 

This should not take longer than one espresso.
Very long journeys are great to talk about, but put motivation at risk.
Break it up, and stay motivated.

Espressos are an excellent unit-measure of time.
Also, pretty much universally understood if not enjoyed.
Let's say it's about thirty minutes of clock time.

While a journey is in progress I simply tackle reaching each waypoint in turn.
When a waypoint is reached, over an espresso, I do some project admin:

```
update the journey log to reflect progress
consider if a detour is required, add waypoints
when motivated, start for the next waypoint
```

The final piece of admin is done when journeys end is reached:

```
share progress with others
drink coffee, go places, do things
```

The journey log is important for a number of reasons.
Most importantly it serves to boost motivation by showing progress and endurance.

To re-eforce progress, I created some automation to generate a wallpaper image for my phone.
Whenever I use my phone I am reminded of what my focus is, and what I have achieved.
This also reminds me that future tasks are not yet important.
